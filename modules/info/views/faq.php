<p><strong>How do I display a projects status in a page?</strong><br />
You can use the [pl-projects] short code in any page or post to show the
status of all your current projects. You can show the status of an
individual project by using [pl-projects id=x] where x is the id of the
project.</p>

<p><strong>Can I change the way the project status looks?</strong><br />
Yes, under the settings page, you have a choice of several different
interface designs. Also, since most of the interface uses the jQuery UI,
You can go to <a href="http://jqueryui.com/themeroller/">http://jqueryui.com/themeroller</a>
and design and download your own interface. Once you have downloaded and
extracted the theme, upload the files in css/custom-theme/ to
YOUR_THEME_DIRECTORY/propel/. Be sure to keep the name of the CSS file
the same. Your new theme should appear under the settings page.</p>
