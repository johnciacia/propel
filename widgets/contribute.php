<p><strong>Documentation</strong><br>
What good is software if no one knows how to use it? The user interfaces
are designed to be as intuitive as possible, and the code is written to
be as clear and concise as possible. However, what may be intuitive,
clear, and concise to one, may not be to others. Moreover, users often
find ways to use software in ways the designer never imagined. If you
thought something was particularly difficult, or have done something
unique, blog about it, and I will repost it here with a backlink to your
site.<br>
<br>
You can also help by translating the project into other languages.</p>

<p><strong>Development</strong><br>
I have received a lot of great feedback and ideas from you. I would love
to implement them all. However, as a full time student, and a full time
employee, my time is very limited. If you are familiar with WordPress,
PHP, MySQL, and/or JavaScript (jQuery in particular) and are interested
in in the project, please contact me and I will give you access to my
development repository. I could really use one or two more developers.

<p><strong>Marketing</strong><br>
The best thing you could do for something you love is tell your friends
about it. So blog il, dig it, tweet it, write about it on your wall, or
perhaps a backlink. Anything is appreciated.
